# My Square project in C programming language

My square is a program which displays a beautiful square.

This program was created using two files (my_square.c and main.c). Also, it has Makefile, gitignore and my_square.h.

This program was created using 5 loops. One loop for rows, one loop for columns, and the other three loops for printing certain signs. Also, it has a main for display the beautiful square.

# Instruction on how to compile and use my_square

1. Because I created a Makefile for this program, you can compile all files by typing "make"

- It will give you the output "my_aquare"

2. Type ./square in your terminal to output the beautiful square
3. If you want to change the size of the square you have to change x and y inside the main
4. To clean/remove the .o files, type "make clean" in your terminal
